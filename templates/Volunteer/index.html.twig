                Search for an opportunity. Non-profit organizations have listed 
                many requests for volunteers here. You can look at all of them, 
                or search by an organization's focus, or search for opportunities 
                requiring certain skills. When you find something you'd like to 
                do, please contact the organization directly. Let us know how it 
                works out.

                Register to be notified of new opportunities - they're coming in 
                all the time. You'll be asked for an email address where we can 
                send information about new volunteer opportunities. And we'd 
                like to know what your focuses are so we can select opportunities 
                that best match your focuses. That's all we do with the information 
                you provide.
